			<h1>Chloe Kim: more than a champion</h1>

			<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics recently starts in PyeongChang. I have to say my attention was attacked by Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn when I go over the news. Unlike watching those skiers playing in the park and worrying about whether they would get hurt, watching the ski or snowboard competitions in Olympics are enjoyable. But the influences of Chole Kim and Lindsey Vonn are undoubtedly varied.</p>
			<p>Chole Kim is the youngest woman to win an Olympic snowboarding medal when she won gold in the women’s snowboard halfpipe only at the age of 17. I remember several days ago when I opened my Instagram, there are so many posts congratulating her winning. She is the only two women who can complete back-to-back 1080s in the world, and her family story is also a highlight that attacks so many followers.</p>

			<p>From an immigrant family, her experience is extraordinary. Kim’s father, a first-generation immigrant, gave up his job to help Kim chase her snowboard dream. It’s been a long road for the Kim family, and one that’s brought them full circle in the most satisfying of ways. Many people might discuss whether it is worthful for Kim’s father to quit his job and devote himself to her daughter’s dream. In my opinion, Chloe Kim is the American Dram of her father indeed. There is no need to judge Kim father’s decision as that is entirely the matter of the Kim family; his dream, along with Kim’s goal, actually make the world to be a better place from their aspects.</p>

			<p>Chloe Kim’s success is also a big step for the person of color. Like African American and Latino, Asian people are also suffering from discrimination and stereotypes. Even though Kim is born and grew up in the United States, she still needs to confront those racial problems. Her success, to some extent, make more people congrats and in gratitude for her accomplishments while appreciating her for representing the United States. What behind these compliments is an increasing sense of identity.</p>

			<p>Unlike Lindsey Vonn, who is regarded as the World’s Greatest Skier and has won 81 World Cup races in her career so far, Chloe Kim presents the further, the group of immigrants, and a dream. She is filled with potential that nobody would say she won’t next Lindsey Vonn. Moreover, she is also a successful representation of the colored people and women. As the Olympics represents the belief that “together we can change the world,” we could also say that skiing or all the other sports make the world to be a better place through developing a collective sense of identity. </p>
